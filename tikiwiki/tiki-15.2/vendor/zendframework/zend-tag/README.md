# zend-tag

`Zend\Tag` is a component suite which provides a facility to work with taggable
Items. As its base, it provides two classes to work with Tags, `Zend\Tag\Item`
and `Zend\Tag\ItemList`. Additionally, it comes with the interface
`Zend\Tag\TaggableInterface`, which allows you to use any of your models as a
taggable item in conjunction with `Zend\Tag`.
